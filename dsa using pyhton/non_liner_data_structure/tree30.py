""" Tree :  the tree sturture is non liner because it does not store data in sequentially manner
            it is hierarchical structure as elements as elements in a tree
            are arranged in multiple levels .
            there is a special node called thr root node of the tree and the remaining nodes are partitioned into
            n>0 disjoint subsets ,each of which

""" binary search  tree: a binary search tree is define as afinite set if elements , called nodes ,such that 
 - T is empty (called the null tree or empty tree), or
 -  t contains a distinguisshed node R called the root if t1 and the remianing nides of T form an remaing 
    nodes T forms ab order pairs of disjoint binary trees T1 and t2
                          

Binary searching tree:
